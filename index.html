                Origami (折り紙, from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" (kami changes to gami due to rendaku)) is the art of paper
                folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture.</p>
            <p>In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their
                culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through
                folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue,
                or markings on the paper. </p>
            <p>Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts, although cutting is
                more characteristic of Chinese papercrafts. The small number of basic origami folds can be combined in a
                variety of ways to make intricate designs. The best-known origami model is the Japanese paper crane.</p>
            <p> In general, these designs begin with a square sheet of paper whose sides may be of different colors, prints,
                or patterns. Traditional Japanese origami, which has been practiced since the Edo period (1603–1867), has
                often been less strict about these conventions, sometimes cutting the paper or using nonsquare shapes to
                start with. The principles of origami are also used in stents, packaging and other engineering applications.</p>

                Distinct paperfolding traditions arose in Europe, China, and Japan which have been well-documented by historians. These seem
                to have been mostly separate traditions, until the 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                In China, traditional funerals often include the burning of folded paper, most often representations of gold nuggets (yuanbao).
                The practice of burning paper representations instead of full-scale wood or clay replicas dates from the
                Sung Dynasty (905–1125 CE), though it's not clear how much folding was involved.

                In Japan, the earliest unambiguous reference to a paper model is in a short poem by Ihara Saikaku in 1680 which mentions
                a traditional butterfly design used during Shinto weddings.Folding filled some ceremonial functions in Edo
                period Japanese culture; noshi were attached to gifts, much like greeting cards are used today. This developed
                into a form of entertainment; the first two instructional books published in Japan are clearly recreational.

            <p>
                In Europe, there was a well-developed genre of napkin-folding, which flourished during the 17th and 18th centuries. After
                this period, this genre declined and was mostly forgotten; historian Joan Sallas attributes this to the introduction
                of porcelain, which replaced complex napkin folds as a dinner-table status symbol among nobility. However,
                some of the techniques and bases associated with this tradition continued to be a part of European culture;
                folding was a significant part of Friedrich Froebel's "Kindergarten" method, and the designs published in
                connection with his curriculum are stylistically similar to the napkin fold repertoire.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When Japan opened its borders in the 1860s, as part of a modernization strategy, they imported Froebel's Kindergarten system—and
                with it, German ideas about paperfolding. This included the ban on cuts, and the starting shape of a bicolored
                square. These ideas, and some of the European folding repertoire, were integrated into the Japanese tradition.
                Before this, traditional Japanese sources use a variety of starting shapes, often had cuts; and if they had
                color or markings, these were added after the model was folded.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the early 1900s, Akira Yoshizawa, Kosho Uchiyama, and others began creating and recording original origami works. Akira
                Yoshizawa in particular was responsible for a number of innovations, such as wet-folding and the Yoshizawa–Randlett
                diagramming system, and his work inspired a renaissance of the art form. During the 1980s a number of folders
                started systematically studying the mathematical properties of folded forms, which led to a rapid increase
                in the complexity of origami models.

                Origami not only covers still-life, there are also moving objects; Origami can move in clever ways. Action origami includes
                origami that flies, requires inflation to complete, or, when complete, uses the kinetic energy of a person's
                hands, applied at a certain region on the model, to move another flap or limb. Some argue that, strictly
                speaking, only the latter is really "recognized" as action origami. Action origami, first appearing with
                the traditional Japanese flapping bird, is quite common. One example is Robert Lang's instrumentalists; when
                the figures' heads are pulled away from their bodies, their hands will move, resembling the playing of music.

            <p>Modular origami consists of putting a number of identical pieces together to form a complete model. Normally
                the individual pieces are simple but the final assembly may be tricky. Many of the modular origami models
                are decorative balls like kusudama, the technique differs though in that kusudama allows the pieces to be
                put together using thread or glue.
                <br>
                <br> Chinese paper folding includes a style called Golden Venture Folding where large numbers of pieces are put
                together to make elaborate models. It is most commonly known as "3D origami", however, that name did not
                appear until Joie Staff published a series of books titled "3D Origami", "More 3D Origami", and "More and
                More 3D Origami". Sometimes paper money is used for the modules. This style originated from some Chinese
                refugees while they were detained in America and is also called Golden Venture folding from the ship they
                came on.

            <h3>
                <u>Wet-Folding Origami</u>
            </h3>
            <strong>
                <p>
                    Wet-folding is an origami technique for producing models with gentle curves rather than geometric straight folds and flat
                    surfaces. The paper is dampened so it can be moulded easily, the final model keeps its shape when it
                    dries. It can be used, for instance, to produce very natural looking animal models. Size, an adhesive
                    that is crisp and hard when dry, but dissolves in water when wet and becoming soft and flexible, is often
                    applied to the paper either at the pulp stage while the paper is being formed, or on the surface of a
                    ready sheet of paper. The latter method is called external sizing and most commonly uses Methylcellulose,
                    or MC, paste, or various plant starches.
